    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Our Story &amp; Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We built this app because we know firsthand how challenging budgeting can be. Our mission is simple: create a budgeting tool that we’d want to use ourselves. Inspired by personal struggles with managing finances—especially during unpredictable times—we set out to develop a straightforward, effective way to take control of your money. As college students, we understand the pressure of balancing limited resources, and we’re dedicated to making budgeting accessible for everyone.
